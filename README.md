## Tarpaulin for Test Coverage

### Introduction to Tarpaulin

[Tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) is a code coverage tool specifically designed for Rust projects. It helps in assessing the effectiveness of tests by reporting the percentage of code executed during testing.

### Setting Up Tarpaulin

To use Tarpaulin in this template:

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
2. Install Tarpaulin by running `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`.

### Running Tarpaulin

Execute your tests with Tarpaulin by using the command `cargo tarpaulin`. This will run your test suite and provide a coverage report upon completion.

## GitHub Actions for Build and Test on Pull Requests

### About GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. For this template, we use Actions to build and test the codebase whenever a new pull request (PR) is made.

### Configuring the Workflow

The `.github/workflows/rust_build_and_test.yml` file contains the workflow configuration. It's set up to trigger on pull requests, executing the build and test processes.

### Workflow Steps

The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Set up the Rust environment.
2. Cache dependencies to speed up builds.
3. Build the project.
4. Run tests.
